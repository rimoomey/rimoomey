## Howdy 🐸
I'm Rimon. I'm an experienced full-stack developer 🖥️ who's been in the biz for a couple years now 🧓.

I currently like to code in `PHP` with the help of `Laravel`, but I've worked in `Ruby on Rails` 💎, `C#`, and `Java` ☕. You'll find me most happily writing code in the `backend` 🤓, but I know my way around the whole stack.

Certified `Amazon Web Services (AWS) Developer` ☁️.

Recovering math enthusiast 📈
